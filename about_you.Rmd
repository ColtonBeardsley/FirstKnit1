# A Little Survey

Here are just a few questions so I can get to know you and so you can get practice submitting an assignment in Canvas.  For each question, insert your answer underneath. Make sure each answer is at the minimum a complete sentence with correctly spelled words and correct puncuation. 

## A short history of you.  
Where did you attend High School, and did you graduate? Compare english class to math, is one easier for you than the other? Finally which subject did you do the best in? Your answer should have at least two sentences devoted to each question.  
  
### my answer     
  I attended Highland high school. I did in fact graduate, and did so in the year 2022. I find higher level math classes to be quite difficult, so I prefer english classes for the most part. English is really easy for someone like myself, because I often read in my spare time. I did really well in any class that involved writing. This meant that I actually did well in english and political science, where writing is a very important skill.


## Your computer and your and its capability?  
 For this class  you need a computer you can use at home.  So, what kind is it (windows, Apple, Linux)?  On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is a total dummy (doesn't know a mouse from a keyboard) and 10 is a complete geek (knows computer stuff in and out) How do you rate yourself?  You also need to have have internet access. How is your connection to the internet where you live?

### my answer   
  I have a windows computer at home. I would say that Im a 7 on a scale from 1 to 10 in terms of understanding computers. I actually built my own computer at home. I would that I have a pretty decent internet connection. At times it can lag a bit, like when there are a lot of people in my house, but for the most part it works pretty well.
   

## Others and You?   
What name do you prefer to be called by your classmates and instructor, if your buddys call you something but you want people in the class to call you something else - what would that be? 

### my answer     
  I'm okay just being called by my given name, Colton.
   
 




## Aspirations?   
What do you want to achieve in life?  What college subject do you think would be of the greatest interest to you? What degree or certificate are you trying to achieve?

### my answer     
  I really want to transfer to UC Berkeley. From that point I'd like to get my degree in political science. I've always loved politics, and political science is an incredibly interesting subject that I love to study. By the end of this year I'll have my AA in both political science and philosophy, which im looking forward to achieving.
   
 




## Past adventures?  
Have you ever gone to foreign countries, if so which ones, if not Where might you go in the future?  Have you ever been in the military, if so which branch, if not which branch would you choose if you got drafted, and why?

### my answer     
  I have never left the United States. I would be very interested in traveling to France or Italy. Both seem like really cultured places that would be interesting to see in person. I havent been in the military, but If I had to join then I would join the Air Force. I had family in the military that served in that branch, they always praised it, so I would follow in their footsteps.
   
  




## Why are you taking Statistics?  
Did you take Math 115 or Math 116 ?  Did you know Math 115 only satisfies a general education requirement but that Math 116 counts as taking statistics in several transfer institutions??  
What grade do you need to attain in stats to not upset your future plans, What is your plan?  
 

### my answer     
  I took Math 115 before this. I sadly realized that that Math 116 is the class that I actually needed, hence the reason that I'm currently taking it right now, even after having taken Math 115. I need to get an A in stats so that I can transfer to UC Berkeley. UCB is a highly competitive school, so I need to really take all of my classes very seriously to be able to get in when I transfer. I'm looking forward to this class and being able to follow through on my plans this next semester.
